# Customer Purchase Data Analysis

This is an analysis of customers’ transaction data of an online retail store to gain insights about
customers’ purchase behavior, in order to help the business, make effective decisions about
inventory management, monitoring dynamic shopping trends, and channel marketing resources in
the correct direction. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values) analysis was used for
initial analysis and aggregation and using K-Means unsupervised learning algorithm, four clusters,
each with about 20-30% of the total number of customers were identified with distinct purchase
behavior and marketing needs.
